  <h4>What is this?</h4>
  <p>This is a tool for Eve Online aimed at being able to quickly price check items in bulk. </p>

  <h4>What's new?</h4>
  <p><b>2019-01-24</b> - moved to latest go-evepraisal</p>
  </p>

  <h4>How are prices calculated?</h4>
  <p>Prices calculated from recent market data from Eve Online's ESI API. Items with low (or no) market volume use CCP's pricing estimates.</p>

  <h4>What does a purple row mean?</h4>
  <p>Purple rows are items that Skypraisal had a hard time finding an accurate and current price for. This is usually caused by low (or no) market volume for that item.</p>

  <h4>What does logging in do?</h4>
  <p>Currently, logging in gives your own personal history of appraisals. It also removes the banner advertisemenet that is placed on the bottom of each page. I plan to add the ability to remove appraisals and more customization/settings that will be persisted with your user.</p>

  <h4>Caveats/Known Issues</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>There's no reliable way to get prices of blueprint copies (BPCs). Due to this, Skypraisal doesn't even try to guess a price for them.</li>
    <li>Non-english formats don't always work properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Is there an API?</h4>
  <p>Yes! A very simple one, but it will probably get you what you want. <a href="/api-docs">Click here to see the API Documentation</a>.</p>

  <h4>How do I contact you?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Send an in-game mail to: <a href="https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Skypraisal" target="_blank">Skypraisal</a></li>
    <li>Open an <a href="https://github.com/Claudweb/go-evepraisal/issues?state=open" target="_blank">issue on github</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>I get a lot of mail so I don't have the time to respond to everyone.</p>
